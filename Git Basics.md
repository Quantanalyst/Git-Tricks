# Git Basics

* **Initialize** a folder to make it a git repo. You need to do it once. 
$ git init

* **Staging** a file moves that file from project directory to **staged** _state_ . In this state, we still can make changes to the file and those changes are not recorded. 
$ git add _filename_

* **Commiting** a file moves that file from staged state to **committed** state. In this state, we can't make any changes to the file. That file would get a version and we can always have access to that version and go back to that commit. 
$ git commit -m "message"\

Note: You need to include a mandatory brief note/message to your commits.
