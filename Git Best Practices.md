# Best practices in Git world

1. Always keep a working version of your project.
  * The recommended approach is to have at least three main branches (master, test, and dev) and always merge tested codes to the master to make sure that it is always working. You can experiment and develop on your dev branch and send them to the test branch for testing and merge them to the master branch when they are finalized.
