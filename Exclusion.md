# How to make some files out of repo

There are occasions that you do not want some files to be part of your repo. For example, your credentials. You want to keep them out of your repo. In this occasion, you can use .gitignore file to exclude them from the git repo. Those files will remain in your local folder, but they won't be added to your local and remote repo.
